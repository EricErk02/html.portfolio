<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eric, and I am a 20-year-old from Romania. Currently, I reside in Bucharest with my girlfriend, Andra. My journey in life has been shaped significantly by my dedication to sports and education. I spent 13 years as a high-performance handball athlete, a journey filled with rigorous training, competitive spirit, and numerous victories. Unfortunately, my athletic career was cut short due to injuries, but the discipline and perseverance I developed during those years continue to drive me forward.</p>

<p>Presently, I work as a croupier at an online casino, specializing in BlackJack. This role has honed my skills in attention to detail and customer interaction. Simultaneously, I am pursuing my higher education at the Academy of Economic Studies (ASE) in the field of Finance and Banking. This academic endeavor reflects my keen interest in understanding financial markets and developing a robust knowledge base that will support my future career aspirations.

  I am a social person with a great sense of humor, always eager to learn new things and improve myself in every possible way. My curiosity and enthusiasm for life drive me to explore new opportunities and experiences.</p>

<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy indulging in various activities. I am an avid gamer and love spending time on my PlayStation 5. I also cherish moments spent with my playful and affectionate husky, Kira, who brings joy and energy into my life. Andra and I often go on dates to discover new places, be it cities or countries. These adventures enrich our lives with new cultures and experiences.

  Overall, I am an individual who values growth, both personally and professionally, and strives to achieve excellence in all aspects of life.</p>
